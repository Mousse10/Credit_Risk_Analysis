# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysi

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. In this challenge, we apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge which is credit card risk. We need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. We use mbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. First, we will oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. We will then se a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Followed by a comparison between two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to understand how to utilize Machine Learning statistical algorithms to make predictions based on data patterns provided. Once the models are applied, we need to be able to evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
